Description: An efficient unified algorithm for estimating the nonconvex penalized
    linear, logistic and Poisson regression models. The unified algorithm is implemented
    based on the convex concave procedure and can be applied to most of the existing nonconvex penalties.
    Supported nonconvex penalties include SCAD, MCP, TLP, Clipped LASSO, SRIDGE, MBRIDGE, MLOG
    as well as LASSO (convex penalty). For a data set with many variables (high-dimensional data),
    the algorithm selects relevant variables producing a parsimonious regression model.
