Description: An efficient unified algorithm for estimating the nonconvex penalized
    linear, logistic and Poisson regression models. The unified algorithm is implemented
    based on the convex concave procedure and
    the algorithm can be applied to most of the existing nonconvex penalties.
    The algorithm also supports convex penalty:
    least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO).
    Supported nonconvex penalties include
    smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD),
    minimax concave penalty (MCP), truncated LASSO penalty (TLP),
    clipped LASSO (CLASSO), sparse ridge (SRIDGE),
    modified bridge (MBRIDGE) and modified log (MLOG).
    For a data set with many variables (high-dimensional data),
    the algorithm selects relevant variables producing a parsimonious regression model.
