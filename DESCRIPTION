Description: An efficient unified nonconvex penalized estimation algorithm for
    Gaussian (linear), binomial Logit (logistic), Poisson, multinomial Logit,
    and Cox proportional hazard regression models.
    The unified algorithm is implemented based on the convex concave procedure and
    the algorithm can be applied to most of the existing nonconvex penalties.
    The algorithm also supports convex penalty:
    least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO).
    Supported nonconvex penalties include
    smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD),
    minimax concave penalty (MCP), truncated LASSO penalty (TLP),
    clipped LASSO (CLASSO), sparse ridge (SRIDGE),
    modified bridge (MBRIDGE) and modified log (MLOG).
    For high-dimensional data (data set with many variables),
    the algorithm selects relevant variables producing a parsimonious regression model.
